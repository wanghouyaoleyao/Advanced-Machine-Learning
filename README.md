# Advanced-Machine-Learning
This repo contains 1 paper, 3 notebooks and 3 corresponding saved models.


--- The notebook named 'PG.ipynb' is our policy gradient model, which has the best performance among all three models, and the corresponding trained model is saved in folder 'tmp_PG'

--- The notebook named 'DQN1.ipynb' is our first attempt of the deep q learning network model, and the corresponding trained model is saved in folder 'tmp_DQN1'

--- The notebook named 'DQN2.ipynb' is our second attempt of the deep q learning network model, which achieved an improved performance, and the corresponding trained model is saved in folder 'tmp_DQN2'

To train the model from the beginning, simply follows the instructions in the Jupyter Notebooks; In order to load our trained model and continue training, please change the value of the variable named 'load_checkpoint' from False to True.
